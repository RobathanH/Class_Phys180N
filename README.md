# Class_Phys180N
Computational Physics and Astronomy Lab - Focus on Numerical Methods and Physics-relevant simulations.

This class focused on discussing various numerical methods and their usages in Physics experiments and simulations, including Monte Carlo Markov Chains, 
discrete derivative approximations, and general methods for displaying computational results.

The shown labs were made to be used on Google Colab, but should work reasonably well as local jupyter notebooks.

This material is for personal use only, and is not intended to benefit future students.
